## Introduction

FrontLine Lyrics is a always-on-top overlay for Windows that listens to whatever is playing on your system and shows synced lyrics in real time, Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, a local media player, or anything else that comes out of your speakers.

It works two ways, it can automatically follow the track info exposed by Windows' native media session (title, artist, playback position), and it can also *listen* to your system audio directly and recognize the song with Shazam, so it still works with sources that don't expose media metadata at all.

## Features

- **Automatic track detection**: via Windows Media Session (SMTC) reads title, artist and playback position straight from any compatible player, with no manual input.
- **Audio-fingerprint recognition**: as a fallback/primary source, records a snippet of system audio (WASAPI loopback) and identifies the song with Shazam.
- **Auto mode**: continuously re-listens and re-syncs as tracks change, with adaptive retry backoff and a cooldown guard against false "previous track" triggers.
- **Synced lyrics display**: an always-on-top, transparent, draggable overlay window showing the current lyric line in time with the music, with a bold, adjustable shadow so it stays readable over any background.
- **Pause-aware sync**: pausing the track pauses the lyrics scroll too, so everything stays perfectly aligned when playback resumes.
- **Live translation**: translate the displayed lyrics into English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, or a romanized transliteration, resolved in parallel across multiple translation backends for reliability.
- **Manual search**: look up lyrics and cover art by artist/song name when you'd rather not rely on auto-detection.
- **Playback shortcuts**: previous/next track controls built right into the lyrics view, plus manual sync-time adjustment, all without leaving the overlay.
- **Customizable overlay**: adjustable font size, adjustable lyric shadow thickness (from none to very bold), and a compact/expanded layout.
- **Pin (click-through lock)**: right-click the tray icon and toggle **Pin** to lock the overlay in place — while pinned, mouse clicks pass straight through the whole window to whatever's behind it, so it never gets in the way or gets accidentally dragged.
- **Multi-language UI**: interface available in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

## How It Works

FrontLine Lyrics is split into two cooperating processes:

1. **`FrontlineServer` (Python, headless)** — the audio/recognition engine. It captures system audio via WASAPI loopback, talks to the Windows Media Session API for auto-follow, fingerprints audio snippets with Shazam, fetches synced lyrics from LRCLIB, and runs translations. It's packaged as a standalone `.exe` with PyInstaller and exposes a local WebSocket server.
2. **`FrontLineOverlay` (C# / WPF)** — the visible overlay window. It launches the Python server as a child process on startup and communicates with it exclusively over the WebSocket, sending commands (`LISTEN`, `AUTO_TOGGLE`, `TRANSLATE`, `MANUAL_SEARCH`, etc.) and receiving live state broadcasts to render.

## Technologies Used

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| Desktop overlay | C#, WPF (.NET) |
| Backend / audio engine | Python 3.13, `asyncio`, `websockets` |
| Audio capture | `pyaudiowpatch` (WASAPI loopback) |
| Song recognition | `shazamio` |
| Lyrics source | [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net/) |
| Translation | `deep-translator`, `translators` (parallel multi-backend resolution) |
| Media metadata (auto-follow) | Windows Runtime — `GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager` via `winrt` |
| Packaging | PyInstaller (server), MSIX (Microsoft Store) |
| Testing | `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-mock`, `requests-mock` |


## Installation

The easiest way to install FrontLine Lyrics is through the Microsoft Store:

  <img src="https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg" width="200"/>
</a>


## Usage Guide

1. Launch FrontLine Lyrics, the overlay appears on top of your other windows.
2. Play music in any app (Spotify, browser, local player, etc.).
3. Click **LISTEN** to start automatic recognition/follow, or toggle **AUTO** to keep it continuously syncing as tracks change.
4. Use **SEARCH** to look up lyrics by artist and song name directly.
5. Use the translation toggles (Orig / Rom / EN / ES / FR / PT) to switch how the lyrics are displayed.
6. Open **Settings** (⋮) to adjust font size, lyric shadow thickness, and background opacity; drag the window anywhere, and use the previous/next track buttons to control playback without leaving the overlay.
7. Right-click the tray icon and check **Pin** to lock the overlay click-through in place (great for when it overlaps another window's controls); uncheck it the same way to go back to normal.

## Building From Source

Want to tinker with the code or build your own copy? Here's how:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/juliocax/FrontLine-Lyrics-Desktop.git
   ```
2. Open Visual Studio and make sure the **.NET desktop development** workload (which includes WPF tooling) is installed.
3. Open [`Frontline.sln`](https://github.com/juliocax/FrontLine-Lyrics-Desktop/blob/main/Frontline.sln) in Visual Studio.
4. Set [`Frontline`](https://github.com/juliocax/FrontLine-Lyrics-Desktop/tree/main/Frontline) as the startup project and run it.

**Prefer the command line?** You don't need Visual Studio at all, just the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (`winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8` on Windows):

```
dotnet build Frontline/Frontline.csproj
Frontline\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\Frontline.exe
```

> **Windows Smart App Control**: if it's enabled in Enforce mode, it may silently block a freshly-built, unsigned `Frontline.exe`/`Frontline.dll` from launching (no error dialog — the process just exits). Either sign the build output with a locally-trusted certificate, or turn Smart App Control off in Windows Security (note: that's a one-way change, it can't be turned back on without reinstalling Windows).

If you make changes to the Python backend (`FrontlineServer`), you'll also need to rebuild the standalone executable and swap it into the C# project so `Frontline` picks up your changes:

1. From the `FrontlineServer` folder, rebuild the `.exe` with PyInstaller:
   ```
   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --collect-all anyascii --collect-all winrt \
     --hidden-import winrt.windows.media.control --hidden-import winrt.windows.storage.streams \
     --hidden-import engine --hidden-import engine.crash_guard --hidden-import engine.media_session \
     --hidden-import engine.music_manager --hidden-import engine.audio_capture \
     --hidden-import engine.recognition --hidden-import engine.lyrics --hidden-import engine.cover_art \
     --hidden-import engine.translation --hidden-import engine.smtc_policy --hidden-import engine.tuning \
     --hidden-import engine.task_utils --hidden-import engine.workers --hidden-import engine.ws_server \
     --name "FrontlineServer" "FrontlineServer.py"
   ```
2. From the `dist` folder created by PyInstaller, copy the `_internal` folder and `FrontlineServer.exe`, and use them to replace the existing ones in `Frontline/FrontlineServer`.
3. Run the `Frontline` project again — it will launch your updated server automatically.

## Running Tests

The Python backend (`FrontlineServer/engine`) has a `pytest` suite covering the pure logic modules (SMTC clock-trust heuristics, lyrics parsing/matching, translation racing, cover art caching, `MusicManager` state helpers) with all external network calls mocked, so the tests run offline and don't touch Shazam, LRCLIB, Deezer or the translation backends for real.

1. From the `FrontlineServer` folder, install the runtime and test dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
2. Run the suite:
   ```
   pytest
   ```
   Or, from the repository root:
   ```
   pytest FrontlineServer/tests/
   ```

Tests run automatically on every pull request via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`).
